## About

Account Takeover Lab is a Node.js application that simulates real-world vulnerabilities and teaches users how to exploit them in a safe and legal environment. The application is designed to be a fun and engaging way to learn about web security and ethical hacking.

The application consists of a dashboard with four levels of challenges, each with increasing levels of difficulty:

- Level 1 (easy): Introduces users to basic vulnerabilities such as weak passwords and brute force attacks.
- Level 2 (medium): Covers more Intermediate-advanced topics such as session fixation, client-side weaknesses, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Level 3 (hard): Teaches users about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), OAuth vulnerabilities, and logic flows.
- Level 4 (very hard): Covers advanced topics such as file upload vulnerabilities, Remote Code Execution (RCE), and privilege escalation.

The application is built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, and follows the MVC model. The user interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and complete challenges.

In addition to the challenges, the application includes a leaderboard to encourage competition and engagement. The leaderboard displays the top users with the highest points earned.

Account Takeover Lab is a great resource for anyone interested in learning about web security and ethical hacking. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced security professional, there's something for everyone in this application.
